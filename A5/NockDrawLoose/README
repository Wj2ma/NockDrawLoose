Compilation:

Run:
premake4 gmake && make
cd A5/NockDrawLoose
premake4 gmake && make && ./NockDrawLoose

Manual:
There are instructions on how to play the game in the game itself. However, dev mode
options are hidden and can be accessed by pressing D while in game. You will know you are
in dev mode when there is a "DEVELOPER MODE" label at the top right of the screen. In dev
mode, you can do a number of things to test my objectives. Below, I have listed the
available commands. Note that a lot of these (namely the view transformations) will make
the view very unappealing, but it is purely for testing purposes.

P - Transform view and perspective to the light source to see how shadows are created.
S - Toggle shadows.
T - Toggle textures.
R - Toggle transparency.
L - Toggle line showing initial direction of arrow.
B - Toggle aim mode.
A - Toggle instant arrow.
V - Translate view some other hardcoded area to see that the sky box did not move.
Arrow Keys - Look around.
Z - Move left.
C - Move right.

Objectives Implemented:

1. Modelling the scene.
2. User interface (main menu, menu, game over screen).
3. Texture mapping (every object has a texture).
4. Shadows using depth map in the form of a texture.
5. Key frame animation using linear interpolation (moving targets).
6. Synchronized sound.
7. Static collision detection (arrow hitting still target, ground, or crate).
8. Dynamic collision detection (arrow hitting moving target).
9. Physics engine (gravity, mass of bow, mass of arrow, bow string constant).
10. Transparency using alpha value (translucent bow).

Extra Objectives:

Sky box with its reflection on a puddle.
